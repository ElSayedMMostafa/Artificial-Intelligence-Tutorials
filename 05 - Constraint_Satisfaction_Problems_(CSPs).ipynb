That is, we divide the state into a group of variables, their legal values, called the *domain*, and some constrains on those variable. A state is an *assignment* for some variables to values in the domain. An assignment is called *complete* if it includes *all* the variables and called *consistent* if it does not violate any of the constrains. A *solution* is a complete and consistent assignment.\n",

This mirrors what humans do when solving CSPs by hand, e.g. newspaper Sudoku problems. Another useful one is the *degree* heuristic. It chooses the variable that enforces the largest number of constraints on other unassigned variables. In practice, this serves as a good tie breaker for MRV, especially in the first steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For interweaving inferences, *forward-checking* is a very simple one. It establishes *arc consistency* for a variable *whenever we assign it* by removing illegal values from all the domains of the variables involved with it in a constraint. This is especially helpful with aforementioned MRV heuristic since it basically provides the information MRV needs to work!\n",
